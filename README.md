Based on the ancient StudioMaster MA36 midi Analyzer. This is a modern equivalent based on a Teensy 4.0. It can display note on/off, bend, modulation, all notes off, sustain, poly pressure, channel pressure, program changes, general cc messages, system exclusive, song select, song position, tune request, timing clock, start, stop, continue, active sense and system reset. And any relevant channel information. 

The LEDs show quick information regarding the data and the display will show Note On, Note Off, CC messages, Program Changes and Channel Aftertouch values.

It also supports filtering of midi data on the MIDI output port, menu driven on/off filtering of notes, controllers, aftertouch, program changes etc.

The box is battery operated or USB powered.
